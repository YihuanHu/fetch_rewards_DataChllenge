This is the data analyst challenge from fetch rewards data challenge. I have answered all the questions on the iPython notebook. All the required packages to execute are saved in requirements.txt. I use MySQL workbench community version 8.0.33.

The ER diagrams is saved as ER.png. Cleaned data are all saved as CSV file with updated tittle. The emil for stakeholders are named as StakeholderLetter.txt.

Further improvement can be done by building pipelines for the Mysql loading process and change the format for each column instead of using VARCHAR(255). Also, I can generate write the foreign key constrains and generate better ER diagrams if I can figure all the issues mentioned on the StakeholderLetter.txt.
