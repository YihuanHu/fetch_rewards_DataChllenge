Hi everyone,

I hope this email finds you well. I have completed the data analysis for Fetch Rewards, including the users, brands, and receipts tables, and I would like to share my findings and ask some questions to gain a better understanding of this data.

Here is a summary of what I have accomplished:

1. Imported the information from the JSON file and structured the data into a user-friendly CSV format.
2.  Created a rewardsList table to record information for each reward item. This approach helps avoid a large receipts table with redundant rows.
3. Loaded the data into MySQL databases and have been able to answer the predetermined questions.

During the data cleaning process, I encountered several questions and issues:

1. There were six duplicate barcodes, which I highlighted in the Jupyter Notebook. To quickly identify the brand of each item, it is better to use unique barcodes.
2. Most barcodes from the receipts did not exist in the brands table. This posed a problem when joining these two tables to determine the top five brands. I have doubts about the accuracy of the results and believe further communication is necessary.
3. The dictionary format for columns such as id and date seemed redundant since they contained only one item. It would be more efficient to store their values directly.
4.  The current format of the time-related columns is difficult to read for analysis purposes. It would be beneficial to save them in a more recognizable format.
5. The barcode column in receipts.json is of type float, which can cause confusion when using it as a foreign key. I suggest either using INT or String data type to store it.

I would appreciate scheduling a meeting to discuss these points further if you have the time available.

Thank you and looking forward to our discussion
Best,
Yihuan
